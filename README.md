# LiMessenger

LiMessenger is a [messenger](https://www.messenger.com/) clone. It has most of the messenger features (a, b, c) and I decided to add a few extra ones such as:

- aaa - explaination???
- aaa - explaination???
- aaa - explaination???
- aaa - explaination???

It has been created because I wanted to get familiar with `type-graphql` and `react`.

## How to run

1. Open terminal and execute:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:gwardziak/chatApp.git
   cd ./chatApp
   npm --prefix ./server install && npm --prefix ./web install
   ```

   It's going to clone the repository and install all the required dependencies.

2. In 2 different terminals run:

   ```bash
   npm --prefix ./server run start # to start the server
   npm --prefix ./web run start # to start the frontend
   ```

3. Navitage to the `http://localhost:3000` in the browser.
